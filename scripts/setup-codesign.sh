#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Prepare a throwaway keychain holding the Developer ID Application certificate
# so scripts/codesign.sh can sign macOS binaries non-interactively, then
# export CSC_NAME (the signing identity) for it.
#
# Inputs (GitHub secrets, passed via step env):
#   CSC_LINK         — base64-encoded .p12 (certificate + private key)
#   CSC_KEY_PASSWORD — password for the .p12
#
# No-op when CSC_LINK is absent (forks, local runs): codesign.sh falls
# back to ad-hoc signing.
# With CSC_LINK set, only disposable GitHub-hosted runners are supported.
# The keychain search list and default must persist into the later build step;
# they are not restored when this script exits.
#
# Ported from kimchi-dev:scripts/setup-codesign.sh (hardening lessons from
# kimchi-studio's .gitlab .mac-signing anchor):
#   * Import into OUR OWN keychain and allow it via
#     `security set-key-partition-list` — otherwise codesign blocks on an
#     invisible GUI authorization prompt and hangs forever (macOS 10.12+).
# Improvements over the GitLab version:
#   * Keychain lives under RUNNER_TEMP (auto-cleaned with the job workspace)
#     instead of a stable path in $HOME/Library/Keychains.
#   * The Developer ID G2 intermediate goes into our keychain too — no sudo,
#     no writes to the shared System keychain.
#   * Identity is resolved and validated immediately, so a bad password or an
#     unexpected certificate fails this step instead of the signing step.
